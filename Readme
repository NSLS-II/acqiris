This driver/device support module interfaces Agilent Acqiris high-speed (max. 8GS/s) compactPCI digitizer family. The original author is Amedeo Perazzo (perazzo at slac.stanford.edu). The driver works with both Linux (tested on Linux kernel 2.6.32-5-686 and Debian 6.0.2) and RTEMS. 

For RTEMS porting, you need contact Agilent and sign NDA licence agreement and then I or Amedeo Perazzo may give you all the source codes. 

For Linux support, Agilent should give you one CD contaning all the manuals, Linux device driver and library, FPGA firmware, etc. If you use Debian, there is a package like 'agilent-acqirisdriver*.deb' in the CD. Read the digitizer user manual and install the required Linux device driver and library before you compile and use this EPICS driver 

If your cPCI CPU board has no disk, you might be interested in using PXE to netboot Debirf (http://cmrg.fifthhorseman.net/wiki/debirf, or google it). 

To compile and build this module, edit configure/RELEASE to define your own EPICS_BASE and then 'make'. Also check out acqirisApp/DB/Makefile, acqirisApp/src/Makefile and iocBoot/iocacqiris/st.cmd if you have trouble building this driver and running the IOC. Use opi/test_acqiris.opi BOY screen to communicate with the softIOC to test your Acqiris digitizer.
